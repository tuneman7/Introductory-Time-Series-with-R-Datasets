# Datasets for Introductory Time Series with R

This repo contains the datasets associated with the book:

  **Introductory Time Series with R**  
  by Paul S.P. Cowpertwait and  Andrew V. Metcalfe

  DOI: 10.1007/978-0-387-88698-5  

I uploaded the datasets here because the links to the data that the authors mention in their book do not work anymore. I have used datasets in these repositories exclusively for academic purposes. I consider using these datasets for education fair use. If you find a repo from the authors, please let me know and I will take this repository down.
